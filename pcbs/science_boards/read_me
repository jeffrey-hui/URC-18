and the required passives (attempt to find the surface mount version of the
optocoupler used on the main board)

-Add 7V supply for annemometor

-decoupling capacitors for all supply lines

-bidirectional logic level converter for i2c, refer to battery boards
for how to do this (Ask Gabe if you cant figure it out)
