rover_description
=================

The rover_description package contains all the urdf related things. It's a quite simple package
There is only one special folder in it, ``urdf``

--------
``urdf``
--------

In here are all the xacro files for the rover urdf. Attachments like the arm or autonomous should be put in separate files and be parametrized
so that different robot configurations are easily modeled.
