All of the useful functionality in ``rover_gazebo`` is in launch files. Since there is no "real" top-level launch file to refer to,
all of the launch files used to start gazebo have *no parameters*.

Launch files

As explained in the :doc:`structure documentation <../structure/rover_gazebo.rst>`, each world defined there has a launch file corresponding to it.
There are no parameters in these launch files. For all the worlds, see the table under ``worlds`` in that file.
